# The Weight of Words When You Are Judged


One of the main application of information retrieval is in the field of law, where legal professionals need effective systems 
in order to access the required knowledge. Classic boolean search method have been found not able to achieve high performance 
in terms or precision and recall and, thus, techniques based on artificial intelligence and statistics have been employed. 
In this research, the focus will be on identifying and retrieving relevant terms for each of the document in the dataset.

## Dataset

The analysis has been conducted on the [Caselaw Access Project](https://case.law) (CAP) dataset, provided by the Harvard Law School. 
The data is divided according to the different jurisdictions and, for the scope of this research, only the portion of 
the dataset regarding the state of Illinois has been taken into consideration.
